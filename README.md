My sources and research of this project came mostly from the processing.reference pages and youtube. I used chat for a little bit of help in converting and for some of my for loops.

There were lots of challenges with this project. I think my biggest ones were figuring out how to get the game to have all the interaction elements that I wanted. It was hard to get it so that the arrays of my orders fit the order that the player was building.
I also had a lot of challenges with running the github website as it was having a lot of errors with the sound wav that I had.
Overall I think it turned out great though!
